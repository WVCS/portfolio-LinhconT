<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
<p align="center"> I am a 15 year old freshman. I have mild autism. I generally don't make friends all that often, but when I do, it usually stays for a while. I really love to play video games read, and draw, but my drawings aren't the best and are better off staying in my sketchbook. I'm generally very silent and mute, but I speak out when I decide to.</p>

  <h2 class="title">The Ness Store</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p> This is a store that I came up with. It centralizes around the character Ness, from the Earthbound series of games. He is one of my favorite characters and I have admired him since I picked him up when I was playing Smash.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Super Smash Bros. Legends</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have always loved the Smash Bros games since I was in around Pre-K to 1st, and I still play it to this very day. I started off I have wanted to make my own SSB game/mod, and here I am, coming up with plans and other things for it. Features include new voice actors for certain characters, newcomers such as Dragonite from Pokemon, Ninten and Porky from Earthbound, and the Heroes of Terraria, from said game Terraria. The game this mod will be for is Super Smash Bros for the Wii U.</p>

  <h2 class="title">Castle Interactive</h2>
  <p class="content">Castle Interactive is a company I plan on running. It specializes in manufactiring video games. Games that I mainly plan on are primarily first person shooters that travel across all time zones, such as Modern, the two World Wars, the Future, Vietnam, and more. One of the games that I am currently working on is a game called "Frontlines", where you control a military operator in an international counter-terrorist unit called the ICTC, or the International Counter-Terrorist Coalition, fighting a terrorist cell called the Syndicate of the Right World. You travel around the world, capturing outposts that they own. You can also control another operator of another unit called the ITF, or the Intellect Task Force. They are fighting a Marxist-Leninist uprising in Vietnam, which in the game is a democratic-republic state. The game will run on the Unreal 4 Engine, and is planning on being released for PC and Console, but hopes are being set high for PC due to any possible complications on console.

    Game & Watch Con is an event that I did, where it was for Game & Watch enthusiasts. Of course, it was fake, but I'd say that it was one of my best works that I have done, and I have improved it for it to look better. It has a functioning nav-bar, a link that opens into a new tab, an official ruleset for all games there, the website has everything.
