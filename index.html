<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
<p align="center"> I am a 15 year old freshman. I have mild autism. I generally don't make friends all that often, but when I do, it usually stays for a while. I really love to play video games read, and draw, but my drawings aren't the best and are better off staying in my sketchbook. I'm generally very silent and mute, but I speak out when I decide to. I am very different when compared</p>

    Game & Watch Con
    </h2>
    <p class="content">
Game & Watch Con is an event that I did, where it was for Game & Watch enthusiasts. Of course, it was fake, but I'd say that it was one of my best works that I have done, and I have improved it for it to look better. It has a functioning nav-bar, a link that opens into a new tab, an official ruleset for all games there, the website has everything.

  <p align="center"> This is my professional email. I do have other means of social media (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube I guess, and Discord), but these are either very inactive and ineffective, or inappropriate, if you say, methods of communication.</p>
