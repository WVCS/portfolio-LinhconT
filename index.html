  <h2 class="title">Tyler1</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Here, I was just simply messing around. Don't ask about how I came up with this. When Tyler1 was becoming big and very toxic, my friends and I made memes of him, and I made a website showing some of his strangest moments.</p>

    <p> This is a store that I came up with. It centralizes around the character Ness, from the Earthbound series of games. He is one of my favorite characters and I have admired him since I picked him up when I was playing Smash.</p>
